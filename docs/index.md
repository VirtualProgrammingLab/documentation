# Welcome to the ViPLab Documentation

> Virtual Programming Laboratory (ViPLab)

The virtual programming lab ViPLab is a browser-based programming environment. It can be used in [ILIAS](https://www.ilias.de/) which enables the execution of programming tasks in online tests. In combination with a management system for research data, like [DaRUS](https://www.izus.uni-stuttgart.de/fokus/darus), scientists can publicize their code together with their results, for others to try out and take a look at.
